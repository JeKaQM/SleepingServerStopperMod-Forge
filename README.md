# Sleeping Server Stopper
This mod is a port of the [Sleeping Server Stopper Spigot plugin](https://github.com/vincss/mcEmptyServerStopper) for:
- Forge 1.20
- Forge 1.19


This is meant to be used with the mod [SleepingServerStarter](https://github.com/vincss/mcsleepingserverstarter) by [vincss](https://github.com/vincss).

- [OneWeekNotice](https://github.com/OneWeekNotice) - Tested the 1.16.5 version.

I'm basing my mod off of another port which has been archived, [EmptyServerStopper](https://github.com/GHYAKIMA/emptyserverstopper-mod) by [GHYAKIMA](https://github.com/GHYAKIMA). I couldn't properly fork their project, they had some dual development setup for both Fabric and Forge, couldn't make any sense of it, so I decided to remake it myself and add some features.

## üõ† TODO
- ~~Add config file.~~ **DONE**
- ~~Clean up files in repo (Organise folders into versions?)~~ **DONE**
- Update 1.19 to v3.0.0
- Finish 1.12.2 port.

## ‚ö† NOTE ‚ö†
An issue came up where versions before 1.20.1 aren't working, most likely because the mod was coded using Forge 47.2.0. I will attempt to remake the mod for any other version that is requested (Just open up an issue) since the mod really isn't that hard to make.
